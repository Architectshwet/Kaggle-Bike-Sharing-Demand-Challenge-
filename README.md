# Kaggle-Bike-Sharing-Demand-Challenge-
Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able rent a bike from a one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world.

The data generated by these systems makes them attractive for researchers because the duration of travel, departure location, arrival location, and time elapsed is explicitly recorded. Bike sharing systems therefore function as a sensor network, which can be used for studying mobility in a city. In this competition, participants are asked to combine historical usage patterns with weather data in order to forecast bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.

Overview on the project:

•The objective is to predict the number of bikes went out on rent provided the data which includes various features.
• Various python packages like numpy, pandas, seaborn and standardScaler were used to explore and do feature Engineering on data.
• RandomForestRegressor and DecisionTreeRegressor model built from scratch and for each of the model various metrics such as mean_squared_error and r2_score were analyzed to arrive at the conclusion.
